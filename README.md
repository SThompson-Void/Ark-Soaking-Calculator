# Ark Soaking Calculator
    Console Based, currently no save files for dinos
# Problem:
    It is impossible to guage the amount of dinos or the time it will take to raid a base in Ark
# Solution:
    Using my Ark Soaking Calculator, you can simulate the act of soaking a base in game by:
    -Creating a dino profile
    -Setting the amount of bullets in the turrets to soak
    -Setting the number and type of turrets
    -Simulating a soaking session with heals
    -Getting the total number of dinos required as well as total estimated time
